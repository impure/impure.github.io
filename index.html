    <strong>Perceptron</strong>
	<p>
Take on the role of a young undergraduate student as you become quite the idle tycoon.
</p><p>
Perceptron is a new incremental game which is based around the idea of building and training a neural network. The concepts behind a neural network have been distilled to their essence in this idle simulation.
</p><p>
Not to say the game is simple. Sure, it starts simple with only nodes, training, and data, but soon balloons into a complex idle game with prestige and upgrades. Not to mention offline support.
</p><p>
Perceptron is not just another idle clicker. It was designed around the idea of training a neural network and has taken inspiration from many neural network topics. Who knows, you might even end up learning something.
